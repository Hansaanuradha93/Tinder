# Tinder
Tinder is a dating app which is a clone of an ios application currently deployed on the App Store. Tinder clone app implementation started with a online course hoseted by #LestBuildThatApp. Several basic features were got from the course and the app is currently in development to add new features, optimization and other improvements. 
Tinder has features such as Card Swipe to like or dislike users, User authentication, User profile details, Chat and so on. Users will be able to filter other users too.
Tinder uses Firebase, Firestore, Firebase Storage, Firebase Authentication as external services. Every other feature in the app is build natively without any third party libraries or dependancies. These features diffrenciate the Tinder app from the app build in the online course.
