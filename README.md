# Tinder

Tinder is a dating app which is a clone of famous Tinder app. This app is started with a online course hosted by #LestBuildThatApp. Several basic features were taken from the course.

Tinder has features such as Card Swipe to like or dislike users, User authentication, User profile details, Chat and etc. Users will be able to filter other users too.

Tinder uses Firebase, Firestore, Firebase Storage, Firebase Authentication as external services. Every other feature in the app is build natively without any third party libraries or dependancies. These features diffrenciate the app from the online course which uses number of libraries.
